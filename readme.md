## User Experience and Interaction Design

I‚Äôm a seasoned User Experience and Interaction Designer, with a formal education in Media Art and Interactive Art, with nearly two decades of experience. I‚Äôm passionate about creating user-centric digital experiences that prioritize accessibility and privacy.

My unique skill set allows me to bridge the gap between stakeholders, ensuring early collaboration for successful project outcomes. I thrive on translating client needs into practical, user-focused design solutions.

I am a pragmatic Designer: I prioritize designs and solutions that actually answer users' needs instead of vanity metrics.

## Media Art and Electronics

I leverage my technical skills to create visual and sonic works, installations, and sometimes performances. I concentrate on the value of craftsmanship, almost like a modernist reaction to contemporary creative technological fields.

Repurposing musical instrument components allows me to benefit from their discrete function, and opens up opportunities to create visual arts or sound art, acoustic or amplified.

## Interface Development

While prefer working with creative technologies (e.g. Max, Processing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and electronics), most recent projects onto which I worked were mostly built with JavaScript and other web technologies (e.g. React, Angular, Phaser, Node, D3).

These days I concentrate in spending more time working on User Experience work and my Media Art projects. I no longer offer my services as a programmer.

[See my user interface development archives](https://mat.jansonblanchet.com/archives/ui/).

‚ö†Ô∏è You are already viewing my profile here on GitHub, so you know I am able to code as well. I will not participate in code challenges, whiteboarding, or any test of that nature.
