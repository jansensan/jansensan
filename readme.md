# Hello World

I am a technologist and an artisan based in Montréal (CA).

I am the editor at [_Arts et Médias_](https://arts-et-medias.net), a freelance user experience engineer and interaction designer, and a hopeful media/kinetic/sound art practitioner.

My portrait has been drawn by [Jimmy Suzan](https://www.jimmysuzan.com/), great illustrator and designer, and all-around good person.


## Arts et Médias

I created *Arts et Médias* as a hub for content and resources about contemporary art, with a bias towards media art and installation art.

## Media Art and Electronics

I leverage my technical skills to create visual and sonic works, installations, and sometimes performances. I concentrate on the value of craftsmanship, almost like a modernist reaction to contemporary creative technological fields.

Repurposing musical instrument components allows me to benefit from their discrete function, and opens up opportunities to create visual arts or sound art, acoustic or amplified.

## User Experience Design

My focus is to advise clients to implement user-centered experiences, rather than simply pushing for the latest tech buzzword. I prefer to work upstream in the creation process: analyze the client’s need, and then collaborate with different teams and stakeholders to create the experience. I ensure to consider all stakeholders from design to production.

Clients with whom I work range from marketing agencies to game dev shops, from tech startups to research labs.
