# Hello World

I am a User Experience Designer and Media Art Practitioner based in Montr√©al, CA.

I have been working in the field of digital production for more than fifteen years, and I have always advocated user-centred design. I favour projects which implement accessibility and take user privacy into account.

Clients with whom I work range from marketing agencies to game dev shops, from tech startups to research labs.

I am available for contractual hire. Do no hesitate to contact me:

My portrait has been drawn by [Jimmy Suzan](https://www.jimmysuzan.com/), great illustrator, designer, and all-around good person.


## Arts et M√©dias

I am the editor at [_Arts et M√©dias_](https://arts-et-medias.net) which is a hub for critical content and resources about contemporary art, with a bias towards media art and installation art.

[Go to _Arts et M√©dias_](https://arts-et-medias.net/).


## Media Art and Electronics

I leverage my technical skills to create visual and sonic works, installations, and sometimes performances. I concentrate on the value of craftsmanship, almost like a modernist reaction to contemporary creative technological fields.

Repurposing musical instrument components allows me to benefit from their discrete function, and opens up opportunities to create visual arts or sound art, acoustic or amplified.

[See my creative work](https://art.jansensan.net/).


## User Experience Design

Since my skill set overlaps many fields, I ensure to discuss with stakeholders during the creation of a project. I work upstream in the creation process, and then I collaborate with colleagues and stakeholders to design a solution.

My current service offer revolves mostly around these items:

- Usability and accessibility (A11Y) reviews of digital products and experiences.
- Interview users and stakeholders to gather qualitative data.
- UX documentation and artefacts (sketches, wireframes, storyboards, and prototypes).
- UX writing (user stories, personas, requirements).
- Interaction design (experimental, functional, creative, artistic).

## Interaction Design and Interface Development

While prefer working with creative technologies (e.g. Max, Processing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and electronics), most recent projects onto which I worked were mostly built with JavaScript and other web technologies (e.g. React, Angular, Phaser, Node, D3).

- Upgrade and production of accessibility-oriented and user-centred interfaces.
- Development of interfaces (front-end) with web technologies ;

‚ö†Ô∏è You are already viewing my profile here on GitHub, so you know I am able to code as well. I will not participate in code challenges, whiteboarding, or any test of that nature.
